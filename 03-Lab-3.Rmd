### RShiny App {-}

For this on-campus lab, you will need to ensure you bring in your laptop in order to complete the Assignment.  You and your partner will work through your data set in the lab. You will need the link below (also available on Canvas) in order to upload your data, set it into the RShiny App, and run the descriptive statistics.  

https://openscience.ok.ubc.ca/shiny/BIOL-116/

Though you and your partner will be working through this data set together you will still need to upload independently. That is each person must upload a copy of the assignment or it will be marked as zero.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

Your TA will assign you data to use for the assignment. Here are links to the data sets that will be used in this lab:

* [Property1_Light_GrowthRate](files/Property1_Light_GrowthRate.csv) 
* [Property1_Light_Germination](files/Property1_Light_Germination.csv)
* [Property2_Salinity_GrowthRate](files/Property2_Salinity_GrowthRate.csv) 
* [Property2_Salinity_Germination](files/Property2_Salinity_Germination.csv)
* [Property3_pH_GrowthRate](files/Property3_pH_GrowthRate.csv) 
* [Property3_pH_Germination](files/Property3_pH_Germination.csv)

## Recommendation Report Rubric {-}

As we near completion of the research project, it is a good idea to get familiar with the format and expectations for your final Recommendation Report. 

See [Lab 4](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-125-Lab-Manual-Summer/assignment-recommendation-report.html) for an overview of the expectations of the Recommendation Report and to review the [grading rubric](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-125-Lab-Manual-Summer/recommendation-report-rubric-1.html). 

# Assignment: Lab 3 {-}

Download a copy of the assignment [Lab_3_RShiny_Assignment_2](files/Lab_3_RShiny_Assignment_2.pdf). 

Use the [RShiny App](https://openscience.ok.ubc.ca/shiny/BIOL-116/) to complete your assignment.

You may wish to refer back to the section on [Preparing your data](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/preparing-your-data.html) from BIOL 116 and the chapter [Tidy Data](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/tidy-data.html) in the Procedures and Guidelines document.

Upload your completed assignment to [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/)

**OPTIONAL**

If you are feeling ambitious and would like to try making plots, calculating descriptive statistics, and performing analyses using R instead of the RShiny App, here are RMarkdown scripts you can use. These scripts align with the figures, stats, and analyses the RShiny App does but you can edit the code to customize outputs. There is a separate script for each type of variable combinations.

* Both response and explanatory variables are categorical

* Both response and explanatory variables are quantitative

* Categorical explanatory variable and quantitative response variable
