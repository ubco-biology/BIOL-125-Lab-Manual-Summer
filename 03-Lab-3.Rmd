### RShiny App {-}

For this on-campus lab, you will need to ensure you bring in your laptop in order to complete the Assignment.  You and your partner will work through your data set in the lab. You will need the link below (also available on Canvas) in order to upload your data, set it into the RShiny App, and run the descriptive statistics.

Though you and your partner will be working through this data set together you will still need to upload independently. That is each person must upload a copy of the assignment or it will be marked as zero.  NO EXCEPTIONS.

Your TA will assign you data to use for the assignment. Here are links to the data sets that will be used in this lab:

* [Property1_Light_GrowthRate](files/Property1_Light_GrowthRate.csv) 
* [Property1_Light_Germination](files/Property1_Light_Germination.csv)
* [Property2_Salinity_GrowthRate](files/Property2_Salinity_GrowthRate.csv) 
* [Property2_Salinity_Germination](files/Property2_Salinity_Germination.csv)
* [Property3_pH_GrowthRate](files/Property3_pH_GrowthRate.csv) 
* [Property3_pH_Germination](files/Property3_pH_Germination.csv)

## Recommendation Report Rubric {-}

As we near completion of the research project, it is a good idea to get familiar with the format and expectations for your final Recommendation Report. 

See [Lab 5](l) for an overview of the expectations of the Recommendation Report and to review the [grading rubric]().
