In addition to the content here, the lab manual, assignments, quizzes, and additional resources are all supplied on Canvas so take some time to look over the information. If in doubt about course policies, refer to your syllabus or talk to your TA. To get started read through your course syllabus and the lab manual. Above all, have fun this term and enjoy the process of science! Sincerely, Dr. Tristyn Hay "],["labs.html", "Labs", " Labs Similar to term 1, labs will be alternating between on-campus and online, with some online labs being conducted in Zoom during your regular scheduled lab section. In order to be successful this term please pay attention to your syllabus where you can find your schedule, mark breakdown, missed lab policy, and all lab requirements for your BIOL125 lab. You will need the information found in this syllabus to be able to answer the Introductory Quiz on canvas. Students will not be excused of any missed or late assignments due to being \"unaware\" of these policies so be sure you reference this information often. Your first lab, Lab 1, is synchronous - meaning that you complete it on-campus - with the relevant material being posted on Canvas. You will have the opportunity to meet your TA and the other students registered in your lab section. This lab will be a very important lab as you will have your partner assigned to you and will be setting up for an experiment. For in-person labs, it is vital that you attend the lab for which you are registered - check your registration online to be sure of where you are supposed to be! Your second lab, Lab 2, will be online - meaning you will work on it in your own time. Your TA will be available online during your regular scheduled lab sections if you have any questions or concerns. During the synchronous labs you may bring a lab coat but this is not required. Closed toed shoes and pants are required for this lab and your TA will turn you away if you are not in proper attire. Any goggles and gloves will be provided in lab. "],["assignments.html", "Assignments", " Assignments See Canvas for due dates. All assignments, even those worked on as a group, will need to be submitted individually unless directed to do so by your TA. Failure to submit an assignment will result in a mark of 0 for that assignment. No exceptions! Please be sure you have not only submitted assignments on time but that you have double-checked they have been uploaded properly. "],["absences.html", "Absences", " Absences Pay attention to your absence scores - see syllabus for details. Students receiving an absence score over 5 will fail the lab. This applies to both on campus and online assignments. If an assignment is not submitted it counts as an absence. Excused absences get a score of 1 and unexcused a score of 2.5. Absences can only be excused by myself (Dr. Hay) and not your TA.

Farmer Elliot has some basic knowledge of farming as he did some residential gardening in the city and thus understands the basic requirements of plants but has limited knowledge of growing mung beans.

"],["finding-property.html", "Finding property", " Finding property In order to start their search Farmer Elliot has enlisted the help of a real-estate company - \"llamaste Realty\". Their real-estate company has shown them three properties thus far. Property 1 Property 1. This property has 19-acres of flat useable land and is situated next to the base of a large mountain. This land comes with fully automated irrigation and a small one-bedroom home. Though this land is start up ready, Farmer Elliot is concerned that the property may not have enough hours of sunlight due to its proximity to the base of the mountain. In order to help determine if this is a viable option for his mung bean farm, Farmer Elliot will need to know how many hours of sunlight is required for optimum mung bean germination and growth. Property 2 Property 2. This property has 21 acres of land with 3 acres designated to residential space and the remaining land is useable agricultural acreage. Running parallel to the longest section of this property is a small alkaline lake. Farmer Elliot has been informed that the adjacent alkali lake has, on average, a salinity concentration ranging from 0-5%. Not knowing if salinity has an impact on germination and growth of munch beans Farmer Elliot is not sure if this is the best property for his endeavor. Property 3 Property 3. Property #3 is located at a much higher elevation than the other properties and located in a very different biogeoclimatic zone than what Farmer Elliot is familiar with and the differences in mineral content and soil texture in this area results in soil pH levels ranging between 6.2-7.2. It comes with a 2-bedroom home and 20 acres of useable ready to grow acreage. This property appears ideal but Farmer Elliot is unsure if this pH range is tolerable for mung bean germination and growth. "],["your-role.html", "Your Role", " Your Role In order to better inform Farmer Elliot’s decision Farmer Elliot has hired you and your partner as consultants. Your TA will assign a specific property listing to you and your partner and you will be tasked with designing an experiment to test the specified variable on both mung bean germination and growth.Due to time constraints over the summer months we will not be running an experiment but rather you, and your partner, will be provided a data set to work through your recommendation report for your client Farmer Elliot. To help you in this endeavour, you may wish to review the content from BIOL116 on experimental design – Designing the Experiment. "],["research-data-management.html", "Research Data Management", " Research Data Management How we organize and store our research data - Research Data Management or RDM for short - is a critical component of reproducibility and transparency in the sciences. In BIOL116, you were introduced to best practices in file naming. You may wish to review that content here. In this lab, you'll be looking at best practices in directory structure management; that is, how we organize our individual files. Just like with file naming conventions, it is extremely important that our files are organized in a way that logically reflects the structure of our project and can be easily navigated with computation tools, allowing for, at a minimum, computational reproducibility. There is also an increased need to provide documentation that describes the chosen structure; in fact, the more complex a project becomes, the more this documentation is important. So, before proceeding, review the content in the Procedures and Guidelines Document under Directories and Directory Structures. After reviewing this content complete the short quiz on Canvas "],["research-question.html", "Research Question", " Research Question First things first, we need a good research question. In BIOL116 you were introduced to experimental design and hypothesis testing. One of the things we didn’t touch on in great detail was how to develop a research question. How you formulate your research question will impact what you study and how you conduct that study. When we think about transparency and reproducibility in research design and implementation, every step we take and every decision we make is predicated on earlier decisions; and things begin with a research question. Well, to be fair, developing a research question is an iterative process, but it underpins so many future decisions - it will inform your hypothesis – after all, your hypothesis is the testable statement that addresses your research question – which will then inform your study design and so on. So, we shouldn’t gloss over its importance! "],["a-good-research-question.html", "A good research question", " A good research question A good research question will help to limit many biases that Open Science is trying to combat in the conduct of research, including HARKing and making decisions after having looked at one's data. A good research question is primarily informed by two things: Research done to date that has addressed this problem. The problem at hand "],["background.html", "Background", " Background Consulting the literature Consulting research done to date will allow you to see how this or similar questions have been addressed by other researchers. Novel ways of addressing the same question are important to move science forward; consulting previous research will help to identify gaps that are opportunities for these novel approaches. At the same time, consistency in methodology underpins reproducibility, and it's consequently just as important to test the same the questions with the same methods in both similar and novel populations as previous research has done, helping to build a body of evidence and identify if earlier findings are generalizable to other populations. The problem at hand The problem at hand will come with certain known and unknown elements. In this assignment, depending on the plot of land that you're looking at, you already know certain things about the soil chemistry, geological features or water sources of a given plot. It is the unknown elements – or a portion of the unknown elements – that your research question will try and address. In this instance, how these factors will impact mung bean production. A research question that asks What is the impact of fertilizer x on the growth of mung beans? would seem a reasonable first attempt at addressing one potential issue at hand. However, it doesn't give a clear definition of what we're measuring as either a dependent or independent variable. Since the research question informs the hypothesis, which then guides your design, you're leaving yourself with a lot of wriggle room here further down the line. "],["phrasing.html", "Phrasing", " Phrasing A testable question Using the word what re-enforces this less than concise formulation of the research question. In fact, predicating your question with what or why doesn't allow your question to ask exactly what you need it to ask. In experimental design, we're testing for relationships - asking \"is there a relationship?\". In fact, we're asking a question that allows for the proposal of a hypothesis; a prediction of what that relationship might be. So, we should think about how we can ask a question that reflects the test or experiment we're planning. A succinct question In addition to re-framing our question to one which is phrased as a testable question, we want to clearly articulate our population of interest and our main variables of interest. When phrased as What is the impact of fertilizer x on the growth of mung beans? the variables ostensibly include fertilizer and plant growth. But plant growth is more nuanced than this, and our study might be too. In fact, arguably, plant growth is not a variable, but a composite of variables; so, we should ask ourselves, \"what do we mean by growth? What about growth are we interested in? Germination rate, germination survival, biomass, height, flower set, fruit set?\" Defining the scope of your population and variables is a key consideration when developing a research question; defining these early means that you won't be asking these questions later, once you've already started to collect, or work with, your data. So, ultimately, we want a question that: Is testable; Clearly identifies our population; Clearly identifies our primary variables of interest; and Is concise "],["an-example.html", "An Example", " An Example Let's say our farmer is concerned primarily about fruit set. It seems reasonable then to test for fruit set. Again, fruit set could be defined in many ways - average biomass per fruit, average count per plant etc. And we may or may not be interested in each of these outcomes. In either case, a more concise, testable research question might then look like Will the application of fertilizer x increase the quantity of fruit set of Vigna radiata? Not only can we test this, it identifies exactly what we’re interested in testing, and it’s concise, which means that we can then readily propose a hypothesis and null hypothesis to address it: Ho: fertilizer x will increase the quantity of fruit set of Vigna radiata. Ha: fertilizer x will have no impact on the quantity of fruit set of Vigna radiata. Reproducibility, meta-analyses, and the evidence base When we reproduce a study, we always know that there is a chance of error or bias resulting from our sample not being truly representative of its population, for any number of reasons including sampling error, lack of power etc. This is why we should never rely on the findings of just one study. A meta-analysis is a study of already conducted studies to try and determine if across a series of studies addressing the same research question there is enough agreement in the findings to accept one conclusion, even though this conclusion may be contradicted by individual studies. Reproducibility enables this aggregation of findings, helping to sift through studies that have suffered from systematic error. To do this well, meta-analyses rely on documentation and homogeneity; studies that use similar methods, instruments, and techniques to address the same question and describe in detail how this was done. This is because comparing two studies of the same phenomenon with two different research questions and two different methodological approaches and data collection tools is extremely confounding and limiting. Meta-analyses are based on extremely comprehensive literature reviews, reviews that attempt to uncover all literature – published and unpublished – addressing a given research question. Your research question not only informs your hypothesis and study design, it also frames your title and abstract, whether for a lab report, poster, or one day a manuscript. Expressing your research question in a way that clearly and succinctly outlines the variables you plan to test makes the inclusion of your results in a meta-analysis more likely, as your work will be more easily discovered and identified. In fact, with this in mind, if you were conducting your mung bean research for a particular plot of land in a particular region, this might impact the variables you choose to work with, and you might end up with a still more concise research question that would allow for identification of potential homogeneity and then for comparing your data against other similar studies in a meaningful way. So, for example, in the Okanagan, your research question might be adjusted to Will the application of fertilizer x increase the quantity of fruit set of Vigna radiata in a sandy loam soil of the BC Okanagan Valley?

Abstract An abstract is a brief summary of what the report is all about. Abstracts in the sciences are approached in a couple of different ways, depending on the sub-discipline and journal preferences. For BIOL125, your abstract should be a single paragraph and no more than 250 words. It should clearly outline the question or problem your research is investigating, describe how the question or problem was addressed and identify the key results and recommendations. In less than 250 words, the reader should be able to attain the most crucial aspects of each segment of the report within this one paragraph. Data availablity statement As we learned in BIOL116, when appropriate and feasible, the data underlying our analyses should be made available. You will be asked to submit a .csv file of your data in long format. You may wish to review the content from BIOL116 on Preparing Your Data and the content on Tidy Data from the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines. You will also be asked to submit a _DATA-DICTIONARY.md file describing your data. Refer back to the Data Dictionary section of the BIOL Procedures and Guildelines for guidance and an example. This is a short statement that indicates if data is available and if it is, how it can be acquired. Introduction ~ 1 page The introduction should begin with the general topic and then narrow the focus of the details pertinent to the research. Your introduction should discuss what is currently understood about the topic and how this ties into the study. This is where you want to get across the interesting points of the field that led you to develop your hypothesis and your experimental design. You want to use many sources, particularly primary sources such as journal articles. Ensure your information is cited appropriately (see guidance in the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines). You should have a clear hypothesis stated at the end of this section. This section will be the lengthiest section of your report. Ensure you reader has no doubt where the source of your information comes from. Your introduction should situate, explain, and identify your research project. It should do this by providing relevant background information that frames the current project and is directly relevant. It should then identify the importance of this particular project. And finally it should clearly articulate the research question and hypothesis being addressed. Methods ~ 1/2 - 1 page This section of your report involves producing a written description of the materials used and the methods involved in performing your experiment. Under no circumstances should you provide bullet points or list one by one the materials used. Rather you need to describe each step clearly enough that someone else could replicate your experiment exactly. You should also include a section outlining what statistical measure(s) you used and how you transformed your data if need be. It is highly recommended you show this to someone not in your class and see if they can follow along. If they can't you need to ask them where they get stuck and re-write to make sure it's clear. Think of this like following a recipe while cooking. Don't leave anything out that isn't obvious or the recipe will fail for the next person trying to cook. Remember, for transparency and reproducibility, your methods are key to your audience understanding how you did exactly what you did. And if you wrote a protocol, it is the methods section against which that protocol will be screened to identify bias. So, it should be clear, concise, and contain sufficient information for someone else to reproduce the experiment. This means it should include things like, how specimens were procured, how data was collected (tools, measurements etc), and how the data was analysed. The steps should flow logically, and, while being concise, you should not use bullet points. Results ~ 1/2 - 1 page The results section is where you will describe what you saw. That is, what the response was to your variable. This should be the driest and easiest section to write as you are just stating what you found and nothing more. There should be no mention of what you did to attain this data or how you went about doing it - that's for your methods section. This is not where you describe why you saw what you saw - that's for your discussion and recommendations section. Nor is it where you try and tie in other research to your research - that's for your introduction and discussion sections. The results section should include all averaged data from observations during your experiment. This includes charts, tables, graphs, and any other illustrations of data you feel best represents the information you would like to convey. It should not include any raw data. Raw data should be attached as a separate file. Depending on the information you wish to convey you may feel that a box plot, bar graph or line graph is most descriptive. Whichever way you decide think about what message you are trying to convey and ask yourself if an audience was to quickly look at your graph would they get that messaging easily. If not, you should look at an alternative way to display your graph. Your TA will be able to help you sort this out as well. Be sure to provide all labels, legends and axes where necessary and a caption which informs the reader of what they are looking at. Remember anyone who is not familiar with your research should be able to quickly look at your figure and understand what message you are trying to show. Please review the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines section on Figures &amp; Tables. Your results section should clearly outline the relevant findings from your study and should flow directly from your research question and hypothesis. This section should include graphs or figures to highlight key findings. Graphs and figures should be present immediately following paragraphs describing the results described by these graphs and figures. While summary data should be provided, raw data should be not; raw data should be included as supplementary content. Discussion, Conclusions &amp; Recommendations ~ 1 page This section is where you will discuss what you saw. Were you able to answer the question you set out to answer? Why or why not? In either case try and explain and interpret your results. This is where you will want to go back to the journals you found and see what they found. Is it similar or not? Why or why not? Did they do something different from you? You can often explain results you may not have anticipated seeing by looking at what others in the area have found. Think about the why? Is this the right property for Farmer Elliot or should he keep looking? Your job here is to try and explain what you found and how it relates to what others have found. From here you will make your recommendation to your client. References All references used should be included at the end of your report on a separate page. That includes any books, articles, lab manuals, etc. that you used when writing your report. APA citations are required. Ensure you provide a properly formatted list with sufficient references. At least 3 primary source papers should be listed. For formatting guidance, refer to the APA section of the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines.

This is just a fancy way of saying that it's an application that helps you write R code. In BIOL202 and BIOL228, you'll start using RStudio to do analyses in R. Right now, we're just using RStudio to write in RMarkdown and to get used to using the RStudio environment. Along the way, we’ll see some R code as we get things set up. Since RStudio is designed for working with R, we need to install both R and Rstudio. So let's do this. If you're running a Chromebook, using a tablet, or don't want to install anything new on your computer, all of the Windows computers in the library have R and RStudio installed on them. While the tinytex package is installed on these machines, it's not loaded out of the box. So, you will need to run the following code in the console tinytex::install_tinytex() If prompted to update the rmarkdown package, do so.

At the time of writing, the latest version is 2021.09.0+351 This or any later version that is published should be fine for what we’ll be doing. A quick intro to RStudio Your RStudio window is comprised of 4 panes. The upper left is where you’ll find your working documents. The lower left is your console. It is in the console that we can run R code directly if needed. The upper right displays information related to your working environment. The lower right is where you’ll see any output generated by your R code, like figures, help pages etc. It’s also where you’ll see a file manager so that you can interact with your files directly from within RStudio. For report authoring using RMarkdown, we'll mostly be concerned with the upper left pane. We'll occasionally use the console to run a bit of R. And we'll occasionally use the file manager to access files. We won't worry at all about the upper right pane - this will have more relevance when you start computing statistics in R using RStudio. When you launch RStudio, unless you're opening an existing document, you will only see 3 panes, your console will be on the left, and your environment and output panes will be on the right. Getting set up Being able to convert from markdown to pdf is not something we can do with the default install of R. We need to get two add-ons to be able to do this. Add-ons in R are called packages. The first package we need to install is rmarkdown. The second is tinytex. rmarkdown handles the general process of reading through your report and getting it ready to be output to a different format. tinytex contains the necessary information to produce a pdf, so rmarkdown will use tinytex for that one part of the conversion process. The x in tinytex is pronounced like a k, so should read more like tinytek or tinytech. Installing Rmarkdown Open RStudio, in the console type the following and hit 'Enter'. install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) You'll see a bunch of stuff written to the console. When it's all done, you'll see your prompt - &gt; - return. Installing tinytex Now, in the console type the following and hit 'Enter' again. install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;) When that's all done, type the following and hit 'Enter' tinytex::install_tinytex() That's it. You should be good to go to open the .Rmd template available in the Assignment tab for this lab.

This will ensure that you are in the best position to attain the highest marks possible for this assignment. Using the template All the markdown syntax that you need for RMarkdown can be found in the Markdown section of the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines. Directory structure &amp; file naming It is expected that you will have a root project folder for your work associated with this lab. And that at the minimum you will have a folder for your report, your data, and your figures. And that you will download this template into your report/ directory. And that lastly, you will rename the template in accordance with the file naming convention you outlined in your first assignment. This structure and hierarchy will be important when it comes time to include figures and images in your report. YAML The top of the template contains some front matter called YAML. YAML provides instructions to all the pieces of software involved in converting your RMarkdown document to it's outputs, in this case, pdf. YAML is very specific to spacing, so don't add any extra spaces! What you need to do. Provide a title within the quotations after title. Provide your name within the quotations after author. Provide your abstract within the quotations after abstract. What might be nice to know. r Sys.Date() pulls the date from your computer and auto populates this for you. The output tag defines the output format. Other options include html_document and word_document. What exactly is YAML? YAML™ (rhymes with “camel”) is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language designed around the common native data types of dynamic programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging from configuration files to internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing and visualization. Read more at the Official YAML Web Site Document body The template is then pre-populated with first level headers for each section you're expected to include in your report. Each heading re-iterates the key elements the content of these headings should address. This is just place holder text, so replace it with your own. Images &amp; graphs There is one sample graph included. Note how it references the figure to be included ../figures/image-name.png The ../ means 'go one level up in the directory' which, if you have your project set up in the following way and your .Rmd file is in your report/ directory it means 'look in the root/ directory for a folder called figures/. root/ report/20220101_Lab05_125_Assignment_V1.Rmd data/ figures/MVD_BIOL125-Lab5_Fig-1-Boxplot_V1.png If you make a mistake in setting this path, you'll get the following error in RStudio (No image at path ...) You’ll also note the following directly after the image path: {width=50%}. This reduces the image size by 50%. This works well for the images produced by the ShinyApp used in this course. As noted in the template, you do not need to write Figure 1: before your figures; this small piece of text is handled during the conversion from RMarkdown to pdf. Any other information that you would like to include in the caption should go in the [] before the () that contain the path to the image. Figure placement The engine behind the conversion from RMarkdown to pdf is a typesetting application, one with pretty strict rules about how content should be formatted - much more strict than something like Microsoft Word. What this means is that if the placement of your images will disrupt your prose - by creating large amounts of empty white space for example - this typesetting application will push your figure to somewhere lower in your report where it won't create this white space. Your figures should be adjacent to the relevant text in your RMarkdown file. How this manifests to your pdf might look a little different; that's ok. References Just before the heading for references you'll see the following \\clearpage This creates a page break between your references section and the rest of your report. Building the pdf If you’ve installed R, RStudio, and the markdown and tinytex packages succesfully, when you open the template .Rmd file you should see an option to Knit. Click this button or select the drop down arrow and select Knit to pdf. This will generate a pdf in the same directory as your .Rmd file. To test this with the template, ensure the template .Rmd file is in your report/ directory and download the following image into your figures/ directory MVD_BIOL125-Lab5_Fig-1-Boxplot_V1.png (4 KB) You should get something that looks like this after Knitting the .Rmd file 20220101_Lab05_125_Assignment_V1.pdf (180 KB) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
