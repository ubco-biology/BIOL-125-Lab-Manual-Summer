*Last updated `r Sys.Date()`*

### Overview of the Week {-}

The breakdown for this week\'s lab;

1. You will be joining your lab mates and TA during your regular scheduled time but online
2. Your TA will go through a PowerPoint presentation online
3. You will be given time to review all material provided on Canvas
4. You must complete all quizzes for this week\'s lab provided on [Canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/) due **before 11:59 pm on July 20th** 
5. Your Recommendation Report Draft is due this week.  Submit your draft **before 11:59 pm on July 18th** to avoid a late penalty or a zero!

**Before lab** you will need to read through the information outlined below in Animal Systems Information for three phyla: Annelida, Mollusca and Arthropoda.

In this lab, you will be working your way through the material posted on Canvas online but during your scheduled lab time. Your TA will spend time going over a quick [PowerPoint presentation](https://osf.io/download/b2v8t) regarding these animals. You will then need to spend a fair bit of time going through the different videos, images, and written material provided to ensure you have a solid grasp of these animals before coming to campus next week for your synchronous week. You must complete all quizzes associated with the animals found in animal systems I before **11:59 pm on July 20th**. Even though you will be getting together this week there is no reason you can't start reviewing all this information ahead of time so that you are better prepared to get through the material during your lab section. 

# Animal Systems Information {-}

### Phylum Annelida {-}

*Biology 125 Biology for Science Majors II Lab Manual. Written by Dr. Tristyn Hay October, 2021. Some content provided by the University of British Columbia and Okanagan Biology Graduate Program students handbook The Fictional Animal Project: A Tool for Helping Students Integrate Body Systems. Adv. Physiol. Edu 41: 239-243 Blatch et al. 2017*

The phylum Annelida includes all segmented worms that have a coelom functioning as a hydrostatic skeleton. Other than the first and last portion, they are built on a pattern of repeated segments through which a \“one-way\" digestive tract (mouth and anus), closed circulatory system (blood is completely enclosed in vessels), and nervous system pass. The annelids do not have specialized gas exchange structures, instead the blood vessels pass very close to the bodies surfaces so that, providing the epithelium is kept moist, diffusion across the body surface can meet the metabolic needs of the animals. However, a number of the marine annelids have heavily vascularized flattened extensions on the sides of each segment thus increasing the surface area across which diffusion can occur. The blood of many types of marine annelids is copper based, not iron, thus giving their blood a greenish colour. Some of the freshwater \“earthworms\” however have iron-based blood so it is red like ours. These worms are common in water that lacks much oxygen. As a result, they contain large amounts of hemoglobin, appear very red and are called bloodworms (proper name is Tubifex) and are sold in pet stores as fish food.

**EXTERNAL FEATURES**

Earthworms have a tremendous impact on the soil. By burrowing through soil they increase its porosity and thus allow air and water to penetrate it easily. They also enrich soils by carrying surface material such as dead plant material (detritus) into deeper layers.

**DIGESTION**

Digestion in the phylum Annelida is extracellular. These animals have a complete digestive system, with mouth and anus. Marine worms are filter feeders or scavengers. Earthworms squeeze organic material out of the earth. Just posterior to the mouth opening is the muscular pharynx which contracts to suck food particles into the mouth. The esophagus follows the pharynx, which ends in a thin-walled sac like structure called a crop. The crop opens into a
gizzard, which has thick, muscular walls. Food is passed from the gizzard to the intestine, where
further digestion and absorption occur. The intestine ends at the anus.

**TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE**

Circulation in the earthworm is through a series of closed vessels. The two main vessels that can
be seen in your dissection are the dorsal and ventral blood vessels. These vessels are the main
pumping structures. In the dorsal vessel, blood moves towards the anterior end. The dorsal vessel
is the dark line running along the dorsal surface of the digestive tract. In the ventral vessel, blood
moves toward the posterior end. Segmental branches off the ventral vessel supply the intestine
and body wall with blood. These branches eventually break into capillary beds to pick up or
release nutrients and, oxygen. Gas exchange occurs between the capillary beds of the body
surface and the environment. Oxygen is carried by the respiratory pigment hemoglobin, which is
dissolved in the fluid portion of the blood. From these capillary beds, blood is collected into larger
vessels that eventually unite with the dorsal vessel. Surrounding the esophagus, segmental branches are expanded into five pairs of aortic arches, or what have been called \"hearts\". They are dark, expanded structures on either side of the esophagus. Although these are contractile, they only function in pumping blood from the dorsal to the ventral vessels.

**EXCRETION AND OSMOREGULATION**

Annelids possess a pair of tubular excretory structures (called metanephridia) per segment.
Metanephridia are open\-ended into the coelomic fluid and are surrounded by capillaries. The internal opening of the metanephridium is surrounded by cilia, which beat and draw fluid into the tube\; the fluid can then pass to the outside of the body via a pore. The metanephridium in annelids has both excretory and osmoregulatory roles. The epithelium lining the inside of the tubule, reabsorbs most solutes and returns them to the blood in the capillaries, whereas ammonium is excreted along with copious amount of water.

**REPRODUCTION**

Annelids are hermaphroditic (both sexes in the same organism). Sexual reproduction occurs through the exchange of sperm packets among different individuals (cross fertilization). The received sperm are stored temporarily while a structure called the clitellum secretes a cocoon of mucus. The cocoon slides along the worm and picks up the eggs and the stored sperm. Some annelids also reproduce asexually by budding off into a separate organism (polychaetes). Look on a diagram to locate the oviduct. 

### Phylum Mollusca {-}

Molluscs, including snails, clams, oysters, squids and octopi, number well over 100,000 species. They appear to be quite diverse but they all have:

* A large ventral muscular foot, which is used in locomotion.
* A visceral mass above the foot which contains a digestive, excretory, circulatory (either openmeaning that blood is not completely contained within blood vessels or closed-meaning that
blood is completely contained within blood vessels-depending on lifestyle) and other organ
systems.
* A mantle is a heavy fold of tissue that covers the visceral mass and in most species contains
glands that secrete a shell. In many species, gills can be found within the mantle cavity\; in
terrestrial species such as snails and slugs the cavity is highly vascularized and is called the
pulmonary cavity.

**DIGESTION**

As molluscs have a range of body structures (eg. Bivalvia have 2 shells whereas Cephalopoda have
none), and generalizations regarding feeding (from suspension to mass feeders) is difficult. In the
case of the clam (filter feeders), the food particles that are filtered from the water by the ctenidia
are carried by water currents to the mouth by labial palps. The esophagus leads the food to the irregularly-shaped stomach, which lies in the greenish digestive gland (equivalent to liver). From the stomach, the intestine extends through the pericardial cavity to the rectum.

**TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE**

Except for cephalopods, all molluscs have open circulatory systems. In clams, two large sheets
of tubes called the ctenidia lie beside the muscular foot. The molluscs are good at utilizing the same organ for different purposes. Here, ctenidia function both as gills and as devices for filtering food. Water enters the mantle cavity via an incurrent siphon. Numerous cilia on the gills beat to create a current, which draws water into the mantle cavity and through numerous tiny pores in the ctenidia. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the ctenidia, which are supplied with blood and food is trapped. These tubules carry the water to a dorsal suprabranchial cavity that leads to the excurrent siphon where water leaves the body, creating a continuous flow.

**EXCRETION AND OSMOREGULATION**

Most molluscs possess a large pair of metanephridia, frequently referred to as a kidney. The kidney plays a large role in osmoregulation in freshwater forms. A very dilute urine containing ammonium is produced (in aquatic forms) and salts are absorbed across the walls of the metanephridia. Land snails may excrete uric acid. These coelomates have an open circulatory system with a reduced coelom. The atria of the heart function as part of the circulatory system and excretory system. Here waste products are filtered out of the blood via the atria with urine then being excreted into the coelom. Any re-usable products remaining in the urine will be extracted via the nephridia or \“kidneys\” with the final waste products being discharged into the mantle cavity.

**REPRODUCTION**

Reproduction differs between the different classes or sub-phyla of the Mollusca. In the class Bivalvia, in which the clam belongs, reproduction is external. Eggs and sperm are shed into the water and fertilized eggs develop into two stages of larvae. The 2nd staged larva settles on a substrate and metamorphosis occurs resulting in an adult form that secretes a shell. Most clams are hermaphroditic, producing sperm and eggs in the gonads. The production of sperm and eggs can occur simultaneously or at different times. Eggs and or sperm are released into the aquatic environment via the excurrent siphon.

### Phylum Arthropoda {-}

Arthropods are characterized by a jointed chitinous exoskeleton and jointed legs. The exoskeleton serves both as armor and as a point of attachment for their muscles. Since the skeleton limits their growth they must occasionally molt to increase in size. Their circulatory system is open with an elongated dorsal vessel, which is a heart that pumps blood forward into the arteries, from which it empties into open sinuses where it bathes the tissues and then returns
to the posterior portion of the heart.The arthropod phylum is by far the largest with more than a million species. Most of these are in the class Insecta (eg., beetles, butterflies, flies, ants, wasps, grasshoppers, and dragonflies). The other two large groups are the chelicerates (spiders, harvestmen, ticks, mites, scorpions and \"horseshoe crabs\") and the crustaceans (shrimps, crabs, crayfish, barnacles and lobsters). Many different crustaceans can be found in the lakes and ponds of the Okanagan - Shuswap region. 

**DIGESTION**

Insect mouthparts are formed from several pairs of modified appendages. In grasshoppers, they include mandibles, which are used for chewing. In other insects they may be modified for piercing and sucking. The intestine consists of a liner passage that contains a crop, a gizzard, the intestine and the anus.

**TRANSPORT AND EXCHANGE**

Gas exchange in insects is accomplished by a tracheal system of branched chitin lined tubes that infiltrate the body and carry oxygen directly to cells. The tracheal system opens to the outside of the body through spiracles, pores that can control air flow and water loss by opening or closing.

**EXCRETION AND OSMOREGULATION**

Insects and other terrestrial arthropods have unique organs called Malpighian tubules. These tubules function in excretion as well as osmoregulation. The tubules open into the gut of the insect and blind end into the circulatory fluid surrounding the organs. Nitrogenous wastes are actively transported into the lumen of the tubules and travel to and passes into the rectum. Most of the water and solutes are pumped back across the rectal wall. The ammonia is metabolized (which costs energy) to uric acid, an insoluble nearly dry crystal, which is mixed with feces and excreted. Uric acid is far less toxic than ammonia. The insect can reabsorb nearly all the water. This is one of the key systems that have allowed insects to become so successful on land.

**REPRODUCTION**

Reproduction in insects is usually sexual, with separate male and female individuals. Fertilization
is usually internal. In most species, sperm are deposited directly into the female’s ovipositor at
the time of copulation. Many insects mate only once in a life.

# Assignment: Recommendation Report {-}

[In lab 1 you were introduced to Markdown](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/readme-files-and-data-dictionaries.html#markdown) in the context of documenting your project with `readmes` and `data-dictionaries`.

The basic syntax used in Markdown can be found in the [BIOL Procedures and Guidelines](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/markdown-1.html). In the Procedures and Guidelines you are introduced to generic text editors for writing Markdown.

Markdown is a powerful authoring tool. Part of what makes it powerful is it\'s integration with other tools, such as <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#R">`R`</a>. in BIOL202 you will be introduced to statistical analyses using `R`. You will also be asked to author reports using `R` and RMarkdown - [RMarkdown is one flavour of Markdown](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/markdown-flavours.html). Remember, the content that you\'re reading right now is all authored using `R` - when there\'s analyses being presented - and RMarkdown.

For this assignment, you will be learning RMarkdown and the environment in which we author `R` and RMarkdown documents - RStudio. You will not be expected to do your analysis in `R`.

<div class = "note">
Your Recommendation Report Draft will be submitted as both an RMarkdown document and a pdf. You will also need to include a copy of your data in long format saved as <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Comma-separated-values-(CSV)-file">`.csv`</a> and a `_DATA-DICTIONARY.md` file. More details on this in the following sections.

While your Recommendation Report Draft should be approximately 5 double-spaced pages, Times New Roman and font size 12, if you\'re using RStudio and the templates provided in this class, you should only have to concern yourself with the length of your report; the rest of the formatting will be handled when you export from RMarkdown to pdf.
</div> 

## Science writing {-}

Technical science writing is an art. Unlike English style writing, technical science is clear-cut and lacking in artistic enhancements.

Do not quote your sources but rather read through the information and write it in your own words and cite it. It is a good idea to read an article once all the way through without making any notes. Then come back and read it again this time making notes in the margins or on some scrap paper. This will help ensure you not only understand the material you are reading but that you are able to describe it in your own words and avoid issues of plagiarism which so often become in issue for students.

You may wish to review the BIOL Procedures and Guidelins content on [APA Citations](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/apa-citations.html) and [Academic Integrity](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/academic-integrity.html).

## Preparing to write {-}

Read a lot! It is important that you have a thorough understanding of the topic. At the very least you should have at least 3 primary source papers you are referring too throughout your report to provide further credibility to your recommendation.

Start writing early! Students often make the mistake of starting the night before the lab report is due. This more often than not results in poor submissions and thus lower grades. You should expect that you will have at least 3 rounds of revisions before you submit.

Someone reading your report should be able to tell what question(s) you addressed, why the topic is important, how you tackled the problem, the types of data you will collect, and how your research helps to inform your client.

<div class = "note">

</div>

## A good report {-}

A good report includes the following headings / sections

* Abstract
* Data availability statement
* Introduction
* Methods
* Results
* Discussion / Conclusion / Recommendations
* References

<div class = "note">
The goal is to clearly describe to Farmer Elliot what your question was, how you went about answering it, what your results told you and what recommendations you have to help Farmer Elliot make his decision.
</div>

### Abstract {-}

An abstract is a brief summary of what the report is all about.

Abstracts in the sciences are approached in a couple of different ways, depending on the sub-discipline and journal preferences. For BIOL125, your abstract should be a single paragraph and no more than 250 words. It should clearly outline the question or problem your research is investigating, describe how the question or problem was addressed and identify the key results and recommendations.

<div class = "takeAway">
In less than 250 words, the reader should be able to attain the most crucial aspects of each segment of the report within this one paragraph.
</div>

### Data availablity statement {-}

As we learned in BIOL116, when appropriate and feasible, the data underlying our analyses should be made available. You will be asked to submit a `.csv` file of your data in long format. You may wish to review the content from BIOL116 on [Preparing Your Data](https://ubco-biology.github.io/BIOL-116-Lab-Manual/preparing-your-data.html) and the content on [Tidy Data](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/tidy-data.html) from the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines. You will also be asked to submit a `_DATA-DICTIONARY.md` file describing your data. Refer back to the [Data Dictionary](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/data-dictionary.html) section of the BIOL Procedures and Guildelines for guidance and an example.

<div class = "takeAway">
This is a short statement that indicates if data is available and if it is, how it can be acquired.
</div>

### Introduction {-}

~ 1 page

The introduction should begin with the general topic and then narrow the focus of the details pertinent to the research.

Your introduction should discuss what is currently understood about the topic and how this ties into the study. This is where you want to get across the interesting points of the field that led you to develop your hypothesis and your experimental design. You want to use many sources, particularly primary sources such as journal articles. Ensure your information is cited appropriately (see guidance in the [BIOL Procedures and Guidelines](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/apa-citations.html)). You should have a clear hypothesis stated at the end of this section. This section will be the lengthiest section of your report. Ensure you reader has no doubt where the source of your information comes from.

<div class = "takeAway">
Your introduction should situate, explain, and identify your research project. It should do this by providing relevant background information that frames the current project and is directly relevant. It should then identify the importance of this particular project. And finally it should clearly articulate the research question and hypothesis being addressed.
</div>

### Methods {-}

~ 1/2 - 1 page

This section of your report involves producing a written description of the materials used and the methods involved in performing your experiment. Under no circumstances should you provide bullet points or list one by one the materials used. Rather you need to describe each step clearly enough that someone else could replicate your experiment exactly. You should also include a section outlining what statistical measure(s) you used and how you transformed your data if need be.

It is highly recommended you show this to someone not in your class and see if they can follow along. If they can\'t you need to ask them where they get stuck and re-write to make sure it\'s clear. Think of this like following a recipe while cooking. Don\'t leave anything out that isn\'t obvious or the recipe will fail for the next person trying to cook.

<div class = "takeAway">
Remember, for transparency and reproducibility, your methods are key to your audience understanding how you did exactly what you did. And if you wrote a protocol, it is the methods section against which that protocol will be screened to identify bias.

So, it should be clear, concise, and contain sufficient information for someone else to reproduce the experiment. This means it should include things like, how specimens were procured, how data was collected (tools, measurements etc), and how the data was analysed.

The steps should flow logically, and, while being concise, you should not use bullet points.
</div>

### Results {-}

~ 1/2 - 1 page

The results section is where you will describe what you saw. That is, what the response was to your variable. This should be the driest and easiest section to write as you are just stating what you found and nothing more. There should be no mention of what you did to attain this data or how you went about doing it - that\'s for your methods section. This is not where you describe why you saw what you saw - that\'s for your discussion and recommendations section. Nor is it where you try and tie in other research to your research - that\'s for your introduction and discussion sections.

The results section should include all averaged data from observations during your experiment. This includes charts, tables, graphs, and any other illustrations of data you feel best represents the information you would like to convey. It should not include any raw data. <a href="https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/glossary#Raw-data">Raw data</a> should be attached as a separate file.

Depending on the information you wish to convey you may feel that a box plot, bar graph or line graph is most descriptive. Whichever way you decide think about what message you are trying to convey and ask yourself if an audience was to quickly look at your graph would they get that messaging easily. If not, you should look at an alternative way to display your graph. Your TA will be able to help you sort this out as well. 

Be sure to provide all labels, legends and axes where necessary and a caption which informs the reader of what they are looking at. Remember anyone who is not familiar with your research should be able to quickly look at your figure and understand what message you are trying to show. Please review the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines section on [Figures & Tables](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/figures-tables.html).

<div class = "takeAway">
Your results section should clearly outline the relevant findings from your study and should flow directly from your research question and hypothesis.

This section should include graphs or figures to highlight key findings. Graphs and figures should be present immediately following paragraphs describing the results described by these graphs and figures.

While summary data should be provided, raw data should be not; raw data should be included as supplementary content.
</div>

### Discussion, Conclusions & Recommendations {-}

~ 1 page

This section is where you will discuss what you saw. Were you able to answer the question you set out to answer? Why or why not? In either case try and explain and interpret your results.

This is where you will want to go back to the journals you found and see what they found. Is it similar or not? Why or why not? Did they do something different from you? You can often explain results you may not have anticipated seeing by looking at what others in the area have found. Think about the why?

Is this the right property for Farmer Elliot or should he keep looking?

<div class = "takeAway">
Your job here is to try and explain what you found and how it relates to what others have found. From here you will make your recommendation to your client.
</div>

### References {-}

All references used should be included at the end of your report on a separate page. That includes any books, articles, lab manuals, etc. that you used when writing your report. APA citations are required. Ensure you provide a properly formatted list with sufficient references. At least 3 primary source papers should be listed.

<div class = "takeAway">
For formatting guidance, refer to the [APA section](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/apa-citations.html) of the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines.
</div>

## RMarkdown and RStudio {-}

When you\'re writing `readme` files and `data-dictionaries` - or even taking notes in class - a text editor like VS Code is extremely convenient and versatile. When it comes to authoring reports, however, we\'re going to move you into RStudio.

RStudio is an IDE - an Integrated Development Environment - for `R`. This is just a fancy way of saying that it\'s an application that helps you write `R` code. In BIOL202 and BIOL228, you\'ll start using RStudio to do analyses in `R`. Right now, we\'re just using RStudio to write in RMarkdown and to get used to using the RStudio environment. Along the way, we'll see some `R` code as we get things set up.

Since RStudio is designed for working with `R`, we need to install both `R` and Rstudio. So let\'s do this.

<div class = "note">
If you\'re running a Chromebook, using a tablet, or don\'t want to install anything new on your computer, all of the Windows computers in the library have `R` and RStudio installed on them.

While the `tinytex` package is installed on these machines, it\'s not loaded out of the box. So, you will need to run the following code in the console

```
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

If prompted to update the `rmarkdown` package, do so. There are more details on `tinytex` and `rmarkdown` in the \'Getting set up\' section below.
</div>

### Installing `R` {-}

`R` is available from CRAN - the Comprehensive R Archive Network - and is available for all operating systems. Find and download the installer for your operating system at [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). At the time of writing, the latest version is 4.1.2 Any version that is 4.x.x should be fine for what we\'ll be doing.

![](images/Install-R_20220101.png)

### Installing RStudio {-}

Once you have `R` installed, you can go ahead and install RStudio, also available for all operating systems. Find and download the installer for your operating system at [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). At the time of writing, the latest version is 2021.09.0+351 This or any later version that is published should be fine for what we'll be doing.

![](images/Install-RStudio_20220101.png)

### A quick intro to RStudio {-}

Your RStudio window is comprised of 4 panes.

* The upper left is where you'll find your working documents.
* The lower left is your console. It is in the console that we can run `R` code directly if needed.
* The upper right displays information related to your working environment.
* The lower right is where you'll see any output generated by your `R` code, like figures, help pages etc. It's also where you'll see a file manager so that you can interact with your files directly from within RStudio.

![](images/Intro-RStudio_20220101.png)

For report authoring using RMarkdown, we\'ll mostly be concerned with the upper left pane. We\'ll occasionally use the console to run a bit of `R`. And we\'ll occasionally use the file manager to access files. We won\'t worry at all about the upper right pane - this will have more relevance when you start computing statistics in `R` using RStudio.

<div class = "note">
When you launch RStudio, unless you\'re opening an existing document, you will only see 3 panes, your console will be on the left, and your environment and output panes will be on the right. 
</div>

### Getting set up {-}

Being able to convert from markdown to pdf is not something we can do with the default install of `R`. We need to get two add-ons to be able to do this. Add-ons in `R` are called `packages`.  The first package we need to install is `rmarkdown`. The second is `tinytex`. `rmarkdown` handles the general process of reading through your report and getting it ready to be output to a different format. `tinytex` contains the necessary information to produce a `pdf`, so `rmarkdown` will use `tinytex` for that one part of the conversion process.

<div class = "note">
The `x` in `tinytex` is pronounced like a `k`, so should read more like `tinytek` or `tinytech`.
</div>

#### Installing `Rmarkdown` {-}

Open RStudio, in the console type the following and hit \'Enter\'.

```
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

You\'ll see a bunch of stuff written to the console. When it\'s all done, you\'ll see your prompt - `>` - return.

![](images/Install-RMarkdown_20220101.png)


#### Installing `tinytex` {-}

Now, in the console type the following and hit \'Enter\' again.

```
install.packages("tinytex")
```
When that\'s all done, type the following and hit \'Enter\'

```
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

That\'s it. You should be good to go to open the `.Rmd` template available in the Assignment tab for this lab.

# Recommendation Report Template {-}

Please use the following template for this assignment:

[20220101_Lab05_125_Assignment_V1.Rmd](https://osf.io/download/kcqjs) (3 KB)

You will receive your marked lab report one week from the time it is submitted.

You can decide to resubmit the same lab report draft without making any changes or you will have the opportunity to review the edits and make the needed changes in order to increase your mark.

If you have any questions regarding your mark and / or the comments from your TA please ensure you take the opportunity to chat with your TA to go over these. This will ensure that you are in the best position to attain the highest marks possible for this assignment.

### Using the template {-}

<div class = "note">
All the markdown syntax that you need for RMarkdown can be found in the [Markdown](https://ubco-biology.github.io/Procedures-and-Guidelines/markdown-1.html) section of the BIOL Procedures and Guidelines.
</div>

### Directory structure & file naming {-}

It is expected that you will have a root project folder for your work associated with this lab. And that at the minimum you will have a folder for your report, your data, and your figures. And that you will download this template into your `report/` directory. And that lastly, you will rename the template in accordance with the file naming convention you outlined in your first assignment.

This structure and hierarchy will be important when it comes time to include figures and images in your report.

### YAML {-}

The top of the template contains some front matter called YAML. YAML provides instructions to all the pieces of software involved in converting your RMarkdown document to it\'s outputs, in this case, `pdf`. YAML is very specific to spacing, so don\'t add any extra spaces!

What you need to do.

1. Provide a title within the quotations after `title`.
2. Provide your name within the quotations after `author`.
3. Provide your abstract within the quotations after `abstract`.

What might be nice to know.

1. <code>r Sys.Date()</code> pulls the date from your computer and auto populates this for you.
2. The `output` tag defines the output format. Other options include `html_document` and `word_document`.

<div class = "advanced">
What exactly is YAML?

> YAML™ (rhymes with “camel”) is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based data serialization language designed around the common native data types of dynamic programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging from configuration files to internet messaging to object persistence to data auditing and visualization.

</div>

### Document body {-}

The template is then pre-populated with first level headers for each section you\'re expected to include in your report. Each heading re-iterates the key elements the content of these headings should address. This is just place holder text, so replace it with your own.

### Images & graphs {-}

There is one sample graph included. Note how it references the figure to be included `../figures/image-name.png` The `../` means \'go one level up in the directory\' which, if you have your project set up in the following way and your `.Rmd` file is in your `report/` directory it means \'look in the `root/` directory for a folder called `figures/`.

```
root/
  report/20220101_Lab05_125_Assignment_V1.Rmd
  data/
  figures/MVD_BIOL125-Lab5_Fig-1-Boxplot_V1.png
```

If you make a mistake in setting this path, you\'ll get the following error in RStudio

```
(No image at path ...)
```

You'll also note the following directly after the image path: `{width=50%}`. This reduces the image size by 50%. This works well for the images produced by the ShinyApp used in this course.

As noted in the template, you do not need to write `Figure 1:` before your figures; this small piece of text is handled during the conversion from RMarkdown to pdf. Any other information that you would like to include in the caption should go in the `[]` before the `()` that contain the path to the image.

<div class = "note">
Figure placement

The engine behind the conversion from RMarkdown to pdf is a typesetting application, one with pretty strict rules about how content should be formatted - much more strict than something like Microsoft Word.

What this means is that if the placement of your images will disrupt your prose - by creating large amounts of empty white space for example - this typesetting application will *push* your figure to somewhere lower in your report where it won\'t create this white space.

Your figures should be adjacent to the relevant text in your RMarkdown file. How this manifests to your pdf might look a little different; that\'s ok.
</div>

### References {-}

Just before the heading for references you\'ll see the following

```
\clearpage
```

This creates a page break between your references section and the rest of your report.

### Building the `pdf` {-}

If you've installed `R`, RStudio, and the `markdown` and `tinytex` packages succesfully, when you open the template `.Rmd` file you should see an option to `Knit`.

![](images/Knit_20220101.png)

Click this button or select the drop down arrow and select `Knit to pdf`. This will generate a pdf in the same directory as your `.Rmd` file.

To test this with the template, ensure the template `.Rmd` file is in your `report/` directory and download the following image into your `figures/` directory

* [MVD_BIOL125-Lab5_Fig-1-Boxplot_V1.png](https://osf.io/download/nrzdu) (4 KB)

You should get something that looks like this after `Knitting` the `.Rmd` file
